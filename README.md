## Safety first
### Road safety
1. Obey the traffic rules as much as possible.
2. Stay alert and look out for vehicles that may be hitting you from all directions even if you are walking on the zebra crossing or sidewalk. Do not let your phone distract your attention. There are electric bikes that running like crazy everywhere, which are a huge safety hazard.
### Personal belongings
1. Attach something like a tag to each piece of your baggage, cell phone, and wallet. On the tag, put down your name and contact details. That way, if you lose one of your belongings, for example, at the airport or on a plane/train/bus/taxi, you will have a much higher chance of getting it back. Be prepared for the worst.
2. 
## Personal well-being
1. Do not buy a SIM card from non-offical channels. Those SIM cards sold by roadside dealers may not work properly or are super expensive. Ask one of the locals (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) for advice in advance.
