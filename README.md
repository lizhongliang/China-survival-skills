## Safety first
### Road safety
1. Obey the traffic rules as much as possible.
2. Stay alert and look out for vehicles that may be hitting you from all directions even if you are walking on the zebra crossing or sidewalk. Do not let your phone distract your attention. There are electric bikes that running like crazy everywhere, which are a huge safety hazard.
### Electrical safety

### Personal belongings
1. Attach something like a tag to each piece of your baggage, cell phone, wallet, ID card, passport, and so on. On the tag, put down your name and contact details. That way, if you lose one of your belongings, for example, at the airport or on a plane/train/bus/taxi, you will have a much higher chance of getting it back. Be prepared for the worst.

## Personal well-being
### Phone
1. Do not buy a SIM card from non-offical channels. Those SIM cards sold by roadside dealers may not work properly or are super expensive. Ask one of the locals (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) for advice in advance.
   * For people from Canada, you may consider getting a SIM card that works in both countries. One of such suppliers: https://www.italkbb.ca/chs/support-mobile.html
2. Ensure you have set the PIN for unlocking your SIM card and turned on your phone's screen lock. This is a must-do to prevent unauthorized access to your phone and everything associated with your SIM card such as your Alipay and WeChat accounts.
3. If your current network operator offers affordable roaming charges, you may consider using your current SIM card in China. Consult your operator for more details.
4. Since a lot of people do travel from country to country today, many network operators offer affordable plans or data packages targeted at such travelers. For instance, China Mobile offers data packages to be used outside China (https://www.10086.cn/roaming/yewu/gmzx/indexc.html). Your operator probably also offers similar plans or packages to allow you to continue using their services in China. Consult your operator for more details.
5. In case you really need to contact someone by phone in China and don't have a valid SIM card, you can try asking a local (e.g. a security guard) to call that person using their phone. A lot of Chinese locals are willing to help out. If needed, you can pay them back in cash. In fact, there may be free telephones or WI-Fi right at the airport, station, checkpoint, etc. Just ask the staff there if those services are available. By the way, the Singapore airport does have public telephones for anyone to make local phone calls for free. China may have the same things.
6. In case you really need to contact someone in China and don't have a valid SIM card, you may connect your phone to a free WI-FI (offered by a coffee shop, for example) and try contacting that person by WeChat, for example.
