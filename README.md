## Safety first
### Road safety
1. Obey the traffic rules as much as possible.
2. Stay alert and look out for vehicles that may be hitting you from all directions even if you are walking on the zebra crossing or sidewalk. Do not let your phone distract your attention. There are electric bikes that running like crazy everywhere, which are a huge safety hazard.

### Personal belongings
1. Attach something like a tag to each piece of your baggage, cell phone, wallet, ID card, passport, and so on. On the tag, put down your name and contact details. That way, if you lose one of your belongings, for example, at the airport or on a plane/train/bus/taxi, you will have a much higher chance of getting it back. Be prepared for the worst.

## Personal well-being
### Phone
1. Do not buy a SIM card from non-offical channels. Those SIM cards sold by roadside dealers may not work properly or are super expensive. Ask one of the locals (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) for advice in advance.
   * For people from Canada, you get a SIM card that works in both countries. https://www.italkbb.ca/chs/support-mobile.html
3. Ensure you have set the PIN for unlocking your SIM card and turned on your phone's screen lock. This is a must-do to prevent unauthorized access to your phone and everything associated with your SIM card such as your Alipay and WeChat accounts.
